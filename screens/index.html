            <p>The HNG internship is one of the most anticipated internships in the country. It presents the opportunity
                for tech
                enthusiasts who want to get started in tech careers, HNG helps to bring out the potential in you.
                I opted for the internship immediately after just concluding the Zuri Internship, this is as a result of
                my drive and
                determination to be skilled in my chosen track. Mobile development with flutter gives developer the
                ability the write
                once and run for various platforms. This is a powerful innovation which saves the time and effort of
                managing multiple
                code bases. Flutter is a multiplatform frame work that will allow me build robust and efficient mobile
                application for
                the android and ios platform.
            <p></p>The Internship is scheduled to run for 8 weeks, this is an exciting and thrilling journey which I am
            gainfully prepared
            for. I have read up articles and tutorials to get me up to speed with the basics of building mobile
            application with
            flutter, also my recently concluded internship at Zuri has prepared me for the HNG internship. Below is my
            8weeks
            timeline strategy on how I plan to get to the final stage</p>
